Facial recognition with PyTorch!

## Newton Access Notes
- username is cap5415.student##
- I needed to connect via VPN from home
- I had to change the permissions of the `id_rsa_1` file using `sudo chmod 600 cap5415.student36_id_rsa_1` 
- Newton had an anaconda3 module with pytorch already installed
- We may be sharing compute resources with the entire class or part of it (and whoever student29 is has already used ~25% of resources)
